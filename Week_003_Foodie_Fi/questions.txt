C._Challenge Payment Question

The Foodie-Fi team wants you to create a new payments table for the year 2020 that includes amounts paid by each customer in the subscriptions table with the following requirements:

    monthly payments always occur on the same day of month as the original start_date of any monthly paid plan
    upgrades from basic to monthly or pro plans are reduced by the current paid amount in that month and start immediately
    upgrades from pro monthly to pro annual are paid at the end of the current billing period and also starts at the end of the month period
    once a customer churns they will no longer make payments

Example outputs for this table might look like the following:
