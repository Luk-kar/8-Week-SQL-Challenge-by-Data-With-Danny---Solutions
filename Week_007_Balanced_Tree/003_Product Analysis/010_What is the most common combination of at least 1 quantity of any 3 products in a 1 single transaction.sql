-- 9. What is the most common combination of at least 1 quantity of any 3 products in a 1 single transaction?  
-- Super bonus - what are the quantity, revenue, discount and net revenue from the top 3 products 
-- in the transactions where all 3 were purchased?

/*
Here are the algorithmic steps for the following SQL query you will need to debug - hold onto your keyboard!

    Use a recursive CTE to generate all combinations of 3 products with no duplicates
    Create an array with all of the products in each transaction
    Perform a cross join and check if each 3 product combination is contained within each transactionâ€™s group of products using <@ array operation notation
    Check if there are any equivalent ranking by transaction count
    Split out the array type back into row format so it can be joined back onto product details
    Final calculations for the question (phew we got there!)
